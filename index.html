                The Importance of Mosques
            </h1>
            <div class="boxx"><p class="mpra">
                We all know that without personal and spiritual development, there can be no social development. Mosques are the places where personal and spiritual development happens. Mosques also double as community centres and places of learning. It’s where people are united in worship, where Muslims come to for solace and support, and where children learn to read. Mosques are the centre of any community where people can congregate for their five daily prayers and Friday congregation sermons. A mosque serves as a place where Muslims can come together not only for prayers, but for information, education and meetings.

            <p class="mpra">Faith is vital to shaping the attitudes, beliefs and practices that lay the foundation for everyday life. Faith unites people as a community, gives them strength, breeds hope, and inspires social justice as well as the perseverance to improve themselves and their lives. Within the Islamic context where the concept of Zakat obligates the fair distribution of wealth, faith is integral to development. Mosques are where people gather to worship. It’s where children learn religious manners and to read the Holy Qur’an. In mosques villagers are united as a community to practice and better understand their faith, which is vital to development.

                Build A Mosque: Benefits & Rewards
            </h1>
            <div class="boxx"><p class="mpra">
                At the heart of any Muslim community, a mosque can be found. Mosques are the beating heart of our community and stand as a physical example of our faith. A mosque provides us with so much more than a simple house of worship though, it is a precious sanctuary that provides a place for individual enlightenment, education and moral guidance; where we teach our children about the Qur’an, where we come to honour and worship Allah (SWT) and where we can come together for special occasions in the community, such as holidays, weddings and funerals. The Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) even helped in the construction of the first mosque in Medina, as it was part of his will to define a place of worship for Muslims everywhere.
